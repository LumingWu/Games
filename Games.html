<body style="width: 680px;"><div style="text-align: center;"><big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Games </span></big></big><br></div><div style="text-align: center;">(Main file name: games) <br></div><br>You have decided to come to a block party in Brooklyn, where there are n game booths G<small><small>1</small></small>, G<small><small>2</small></small>, ..., G<small><small>n</small></small>
from one end of the street to the other. You want to play&nbsp;all of
the games in the order from G<small><small>1</small></small> to&nbsp; G<small><small>n</small></small> without skipping any. The games are not free, and each game
costs 1 token to play once. You can play a game as many times as you
can, as long as you have enough tokens. Your pocket can hold at most T
tokens, and the pocket is full in the beginning. After you finish one
game G<small><small>i</small></small> and before you start G<small><small>i+1</small></small>,
you will be refilled with&nbsp;K tokens. However, since the capacity of&nbsp;your pocket is T, any extra tokens will be wasted.<br><br>Some
games are more fun than others. For each game Gi, you have an integer
value Vi that indicates how fun this game is to you. For a game that
you
don't enjoy, the value can be negative. Note that you have to play each
game at least once, even if the game is not fun to you. The&nbsp;total fun
you gain from a game is the number of times you play the game times the
fun value. You want to manage your tokens so that you gain the most fun
from the games.<br><br><br><h2>Input&nbsp;Formats</h2>
An input file for LP systems contains a fact of the form num(N), which
specifies
the number of games N (4&nbsp;&#8804;  N &#8804;  10), a fact of the form cap(T),
which means that&nbsp;the capacity of your pocket is T
(3&nbsp;&#8804;  T&nbsp;&#8804;  10), a fact of the form refill(K), which gives the number
to tokens you receive after each game booth (0 &lt; K&nbsp;&#8804; &nbsp;T); N facts of the form
fun(i,Vi), which indicates that the fun value of game Gi is Vi
(1&nbsp;&#8804;  i&nbsp;&#8804;  N, -10&nbsp;&#8804;  Vi &nbsp;&#8804; 10).<br><br>An input file for Minizinc specifies
the following constants: num, the
number of games N; cap, the capacity of your pocket; refill, the number
of tokens you receive after each game booth; fun, an&nbsp;array of fun
values of the N games.<br><br><h2 class="main">Output format</h2>The output should
contain exactly one fact of the form total_fun(V), where V is the maximum fun you can gain from playing these games. &nbsp;For
ASP systems, the output may consist of multiple answer sets,&nbsp;and only the final one is treated as a solution.<br><br><h2 class="main">Samples</h2><span class="style1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span> <span class="style1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></span><table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;">LP Input</td><td style="text-align: center;">Minizinc Input</td><td style="text-align: center;">Output</td></tr><tr><td>num(4).<br>cap(5).<br>refill(2).<br>fun(1,4).<br>fun(2,1).<br>fun(3,2).<br>fun(4,3).<br></td><td>num =&nbsp;4;<br>cap = 5;<br>refill = 2;<br>fun = [4,1,2,3];<br></td><td>total_fun(35).<br></td></tr><tr><td>num(4).<br>cap(5).<br>refill(2).<br>fun(1,4).<br>fun(2,-1).<br>fun(3,-2).<br>fun(4,3).<br></td><td>num =&nbsp;4;<br>cap = 5;<br>refill = 2;<br>fun = [4,-1,-2,3];</td><td>total_fun(29).</td></tr><tr><td> num(5).<br>cap(3).<br>refill(2).<br>fun(1,4).<br>fun(2,1).<br>fun(3,-2).<br>fun(4,3).<br>fun(5,4).</td><td>num = 5;<br>cap = 3;<br>refill = 2;<br>fun = [4,1,-2,3,4];</td><td>total_fun(30).</td></tr></tbody></table><br></body></html>
